## Overview of the Paper

This study, "Exploring the Impact of Atypical Events on Regret: Analysis Through Hitchhiker Car Accident and Robbery Scenarios," replicates and extends Kutscher and Feldman's work on norm theory. We examined the extent to which people feel regret in the face of exceptional and routine events by studying three different scenarios: hitchhiking, car accidents, and robberies. The findings suggest that people tend to regret more when faced with exceptional situations. We also found that compensation judgments remained roughly consistent across the two scenarios.
